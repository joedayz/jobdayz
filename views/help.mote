  </p>

  <h4 id="adding_a_message_to_an_application">Adding a message to an application</h4>
  <p >
    After you apply for a job you'll have the chance to add a one-time short message to your application. You can use this message to add any extra information specific for this post.

  <h4 id="application_status">Application status</h4>
  <p>
    Each application will have the status "active" or "discarded".
  </p>
  <p>
    "Active" means you're still being considered for the position.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Discarded" means that you haven't been selected for the position but they'll still be able to see your application. Don't worry too much, there're more jobs waiting for you!

  <p>
    If you applied for a job and then change your mind you can remove your application.

  </p>
  <p>
    Some advice:
  </p>
  <p>
    The description has a limit of 600 characters because we know developers prefer short and specific task post descriptions. Try to be brief and straight to the point about what you seek and what you have to offer. This way you'll attract the best applicants for the job!
